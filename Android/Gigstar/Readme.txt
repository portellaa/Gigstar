============ Status ============

Except the twitter share all the features are implemented.
The Facebook API can be used to more things but now its only used for share events.

============ Theme ============

The theme was created by us to be the most look like iOS.

The title bar its all customized and haves left and right button like iOS.
This buttons can be personalized, like text changed, image changed, among others.

The Button, EditText and ListView hast the same look has the iOS and the same behavior.

The application theme has all builded by the team.

============ Map Annotations ============

The user ping annotation its created by us and haves the same look has the iOS.

The pin annotation its created by us and haves the same look has the iOS.

The annotations was created by us, but thanks to a bug we search for some help on the web. We found a open project and check what we are doing wrong, and use it to correct out problem.

So we do not use his project and library but create our own annotation.
The author of the code that help us to solve the problem is Jeff Gilfelt and his project his hosted on github, on the link https://github.com/jgilfelt/android-mapviewballoons.

The map annotations has the same behavior has the iOS annotations. With some theme problems because the position but its working nice.

The API that we use to get the events on a location its limited and a mess. It returns different events with the same location, so sometimes we are not able to see more than one pin on the screen. In locations with more events it works fine, like other countries, lisbon, etc.

============ Custom Activity ============

To support the new title bar a custom activity has been created to replace the title bar, and place buttons.
This activity enable access to the buttons directly.

============ Running the application ============

The application do not requires any special arguments or acknowledge.


============ Improvements ============

Some features may be bug fixed.
Replace most of the created Threads by Async Tasks. We are using it to get images when the Artist details activity is launched and on the lists that haves images.
